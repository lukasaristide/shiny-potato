**Shiny Potato - an immersive game of potatoes**

A bubble shooter type of game. Shoot colourful potatoes and watch them disappear with a burst of light. However, at least three of the same colour must be matched for this to happen. Additionally, every few moves new line of potatoes appears and once they touch bottom, game ends. How high can you score?

Features:
- high score table
- animated shiny potatoes of different colours

**How to play**

Simply copy the shiny-potato/release/ folder and run 'Shiny Potato.jar'. For some reasons, You'd better run it from the command line (using "java -jar ./Shiny\ Potato.jar" command, present in file Play.sh). 
You can alternatively just compile this as an Eclipse project and run in this way.
